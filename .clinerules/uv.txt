# Project Development Rules

## Python Environment and Execution

- **Use `uv`:** All Python scripts and module management (installation, updates, etc.) must be performed using `uv`. This ensures consistency and leverages `uv`'s performance benefits.

    *Example (running a script):*
    ```bash
    uv run python your_script.py
    ```

    *Example (adding packages):*
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name>
    ```

    *Example (sync packages):*
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    *Rationale:* Standardizing on `uv` simplifies environment setup and dependency management across the team.
